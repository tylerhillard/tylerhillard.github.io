			<h3>Economic Research Paper - National Debt</h3>
			<p>This twelve-page research paper analyzes the national debt of the United States by using the film documentary "Ten Trillion and Counting" presented by Frontline. The paper is divided into three parts. The first part of the paper is the executive summary, which gives an overview of the film. The second part is based on follow-up questions of the film, such as important ideas, recommendations to the government, etc. The third part is the research paper questions and graphs. The research questions will use two graphs to give answers analyzing how each administration handled those issues. The paper discusses the reasons, probable outcomes, and possible solutions to America's $10 trillion debt through interviews with renowned experts and insiders in government finance.</p>
